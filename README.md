# BitBurner-Scripts
A repository of files to use in the game Bitburner. Add them with `wget "url.to/file" local-file-name`.

## Rationale
I started this game from scratch and haven't used any scripts from sources other than the documentation or tutorial.
I want to savor this game and then compare at the end to what others have come up with.
Also, typescript coulda/shoulda/woulda been used but wasn't. I forgot.

## Progress So Far
The files are mainly used to ease restarts after augmentation installations for now. Nothing is automated in the sense of "set-it-and-forget-it" as of yet. There is something on the way for stocks (autoStocks.js) and hacknet nodes (agNode.js) which is meant to be just that.
